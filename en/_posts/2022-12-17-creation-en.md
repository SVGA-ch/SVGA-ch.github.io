The Swiss Video Game Archivists (SVGA) was founded on 17 December 2022. This project follows Memoriav's Pixelvetica pilot project.. Its members mostly were previous active in Pixelvetica, and others come from a diverse range of domains and institutions.

The Pixelvetica pilot project (2021-2022), commissioned by Memoriav, had as its mission to establish the state of play and the needs concerning the preservation of video games in Switzerland. The team consisted of seven people from different fields of expertise in the fields of cultural preservation and video games. The findings of the project highlighted the lack of resources in this area, particularly with regard to identifying professionals in the sector. That is why this new association was launched.

The aim of this professional association is to open up to all people and professionals interested in the preservation of video games in Switzerland, but also to bring together professionals in video game archiving and to promote the preservation of video games. Several projects are already in the works, particularly with regard to collaborations with Swiss cultural institutions and support for the development of useful resources in this area.
